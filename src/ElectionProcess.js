          To choose a candidate for the general election, political parties use two key methods: <strong>Primaries</strong> and <strong>Caucuses</strong>. These processes determine which candidate will represent the party in the final election.
        </p>
        <div className="subsection">
          <h3>Primaries</h3>
          <p>Primaries are <strong>organized like regular elections</strong>, where party members cast their votes in a secret ballot for the candidate of their choice. The results of the primary determine how many delegates each candidate will receive to represent them at
          the party’s national convention.</p>
          <br/>
          <b>Types of Primaries</b>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Primary:</strong> In an open primary, voters are <b>not required to be registered members</b> of a political party to participate.</li>
            <strong>Q. Who can vote?</strong>
            <p>Any eligible voter, regardless of their political affiliation.</p>
            <br/>
            <li><strong>Closed Primary:</strong> In a closed primary, only voters who are <strong>registered party members</strong> can participate.</li>
            <strong>Q. Who can vote?</strong>
            <p>Only voters registered with the specific political party.</p>

          <h3>Caucuses</h3>
          <p>
            Caucuses are a more interactive and community-driven process for selecting a candidate. Unlike a regular election, caucuses involve group discussions and votes instead of secret ballots.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Meetings:</strong>
              <p>▶ Party members gather in local precincts (e.g., schools, community centers, or town halls) for <strong>face-to-face
              discussions.</strong> </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Candidate Support:</strong> <p>▶ Participants form groups to show support for their preferred candidate.</p> <p>▶ They can discuss, debate, and try to convince others to join their group.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Voting:</strong>
              <p>▶ After discussions, party members vote publicly, either by a <strong>show of hands</strong> or by physically moving to
              different sections of the room. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delegate Selection:</strong> 
              <p>▶ Based on caucus results, delegates are assigned to candidates.</p>
              <p>▶ These delegates will represent the candidate at county, state, and eventually national conventions.</p>

        After the primaries and caucuses conclude, each political party holds a significant event called
        the <strong>National Conventions</strong>. These conventions are key milestones in the U.S. election process
        where the final candidate for president is officially selected to represent the party.

          Delegates formally cast their votes to confirm the party's final presidential nominee.

        After the primaries, caucuses, and national conventions are complete, the final stage begins: <strong> The General Election</strong>. This
is when voters across the entire country come together to make their choice for the next President and Vice President of
the United States.

        <h3>How the General Election Works</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong> Voting for the President and Vice President:</strong>
            <p>On Election Day, citizens head to polling stations to cast their votes for their preferred presidential and
            vice-presidential candidates.</p>
            <p>However, voters are not directly voting for the candidates themselves. Instead, they are voting for electors
            who are members of the Electoral College.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> The Electoral College System:</strong>
            <p>The United States uses a system called the Electoral College to determine the winner of the presidential
            election.</p>
            <p>Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress:</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> "Winner-Takes-All" System (in Most States):</strong>
            <p>In nearly all states, the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote in that state gets all of the
            state’s electoral votes.</p>
            <p>For example, if Candidate A wins 51% of the votes in Texas, Candidate A receives all of Texas' electoral
            votes.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

          <p>The Electoral College plays a crucial role in determining who becomes the next President of the United States. While citizens vote during the general election, the actual
        selection of the president happens through this system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total Electoral Votes:</strong> 
            <p>There are <strong> 538 total electoral votes</strong> in the United States.</p>
            <p>This number is based on the total membership of Congress:</p>
            <p>▶  <strong> 100 Senators </strong>(2 per state)</p>
            <p>▶  <strong> 435 Representatives </strong>(varies by state population)</p>
            <p>▶  <strong> 3 electors </strong> for the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.).</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>State Representation:</strong> 
            <p>Each state gets a specific number of electors based on its representation in Congress.</p>
            <p>The formula: State’s Electors=2 (Senators)+Number of Representatives:</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
            <p>▶  California, the most populous state, has <strong>55 electoral votes </strong> (2 senators + 53 representatives). </p>
            <p>▶  Vermont, one of the smallest states, has <strong> 3 electoral votes </strong>(2 senators + 1 representative).</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Winning Electoral Votes:</strong> 
            <p>When citizens in a state vote for a presidential candidate, they are actually voting for a group of electors who have pledged to support that candidate.</p>
            <p><strong>Winner-Takes-All Rule:</strong></p>
            <p>▶  In 48 states and Washington D.C., the candidate who wins the most votes in that state receives <strong> all of the state’s electoral votes</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
            <p>▶  Maine and Nebraska use a <strong> proportional system</strong>, where electoral votes are split based on the outcome in each congressional district and the overall
            state winner.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
          <strong>Majority Needed to Win:</strong>
          <p> To become President, a candidate must win a <strong> majority</strong> of the electoral votes:</p> 
          <p>▶  <strong>270 out of 538 votes.</strong></p>
          <p>If no candidate reaches 270 votes, the election is decided in the <strong>House of Representatives</strong>, where each state delegation gets one vote.</p>
